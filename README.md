We have made a web app named covid-19 help . It has two sections - healthcare and shop . 

Under the shop part , the consumers can choose whether they want to order medicines or groceries and go into the respective sub-section and choose the store they want to order from . Upon selecting the store , a chat window opens up and he/she can send his order and discuss the availability of goods with the supplier. 

Under healthcare , there is a list of various specialist doctors who provide phone or video calling options and you can consult them by their given email-id . And under mental self-help we recommend books and music for therapy .

In this way , we tried to cover all the essential requirements for the customer while he stays at home.
 
Also , while logging in you will be asked whether you are a consumer or supplier and the details will be taken accordingly.
