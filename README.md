We are thinking of a web app that will establish relation between the supplier/professionals to the customers/patients.

We will start with a login for the user. Upon login, he can have options of either the stores available in his vicinity or medical aid.

In stores category, we will have a chat app where the person can interact with the supplier and ask for the requirements/things to be delivered at home. (Such as in the case of corona)

In medical aid, we will provide professional help from the doctors for physical and mental health as per required.
Since getting to doctors in this pandemic has been quite difficult unless its a case of emergency
